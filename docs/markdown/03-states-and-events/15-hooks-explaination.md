# Hooks

#### from the docs:

* Hooks are a new feature that lets you use state and other React features without writing a class
* Classes confuse both people and machines
* There are no plans to remove classes from React.

<br/>

*Hooks donâ€™t replace your knowledge of React concepts. Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. As we will show later, Hooks also offer a new powerful way to combine them.*
