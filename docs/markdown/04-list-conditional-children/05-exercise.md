# Exercise 04: lists of persons
## repeat yourself

* Change App so you can switch between a List and a Carousel of PersonCards
    * use the action item in Header to toggle the views
    * sure, this is normally done with a router… patience…

* Create the Carousel component displaying anything you pass as children
    * there must not remain any reference to PersonCard
